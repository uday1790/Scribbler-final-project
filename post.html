    <p id="para1">Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music [U] Hendrix
        expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His
        boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as distortion forever transformed
        the sound of rock and roll. While creating his unique musical voice and guitar style. Hendrix synthesized
        diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock and roll psychedelic
        and jazz. Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain.[119] He was instrumental in
        developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and helped to popularize use of
        the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock [348] He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most
        guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb.[349] He applied this technique
        during the beginning bars of "Little Wing", which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also
        playing melody. This method has been described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand
        would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand.[350] Having spent several years fronting a
        trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that
        more than one guitarist was performing [351][nb 41] He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing
        effects in rock music recordings. [354] Holly George Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix pioneered the
        use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and
        distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as
        personal as the blues with which he began. "[3][nb 42] Aledort wrote: "In rock guitar, there are but two eras -
        before Hendrix and after Hendrix"</p>
